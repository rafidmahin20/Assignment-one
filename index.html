                The Batmobile is a classification given to certain models of
                Batman's fleet of road vehicles. While Batman himself most often
                referred to the vehicle simply as "The Car", Dick Grayson
                started calling it "The Batmobile" and the name stuck.

            Raised by his parents (better known as the "Flying Graysons") in a
            circus, Dick Grayson was trained to be incredibly acrobatic. His
            parents were killed after criminals had failed to extort money from
            the circus. Dick was soon adopted by billionaire Bruce Wayne, who
            shared his secret identity and extensively trained the boy to become
            Batman's sidekick, the first Robin.
