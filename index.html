          In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on
          the criminals of Gotham City. He is vengeance. He is the night. He is
          Batman.

            <p style="font-size: 15px">
              The Batmobile is a classification given to certain models of
              Batman's fleet of road vehicles. While Batman himself most often
              referred to the vehicle simply as "The Car", Dick Grayson started
              calling it "The Batmobile" and the name stuck.

            <p style="font-size: 15px">
              The Batcave is the home, sanctuary, and base of operations for
              Batman and the Bat Family. Located directly underneath Wayne
              Manor.

            <h3>Batwing</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 15px">
              The Batwing is Batman's personal aircraft. He sometimes traveled
              in it as an alternative to the Batmobile, and it could also be
              controlled remotely to deliver items.

          Raised by his parents (better known as the "Flying Graysons") in a
          circus, Dick Grayson was trained to be incredibly acrobatic. His
          parents were killed after criminals had failed to extort money from
          the circus. Dick was soon adopted by billionaire Bruce Wayne, who
          shared his secret identity and extensively trained the boy to become
          Batman's sidekick, the first Robin.
